        <p>An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.
            Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, 
            and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; 
            the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
